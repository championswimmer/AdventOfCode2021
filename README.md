# Advent of Code 2021 
All solutions in `Rust`, `Go`, `TypeScript` and `Kotlin` 

## Running

There is a sample `run-solns.sh` script that contains
the commands to run all solutions.

## Setup 

### Kotlin 
The Kotlin files are run via [kscript](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript)

Best way is to install via <https://sdkman.io>

```shell 
sdk install kotlin
sdk install kscript
```

### Rust 
The Rust files are run via [rust-script](https://rust-script.org/)

First [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (via appropriate package manager for your OS),
then install the rust-script crate. 

```shell
cargo install rust-script
```

### TypeScript
The TypeScript files are run via [deno](https://deno.land/)

[Install Deno](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) via appropriate package manager for your OS.


```shell
npm install ts-node
```

### Go 
The Go files are run via Go's own `go run` process which can 
run a file like a script. 

Just [install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) via your package manager and get going.
